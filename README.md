# Using Machine Learning to Classify NBA Injuries

This project aims to apply machine learning (ML) techniques to the problem of resting players in NBA games strategically. Specifically, we seek to understand what factors contribute to games in which players get injured, and also to see if we can train an ML algorithm to decide whether players should be rested for a given game. This second task is a difficult one, particularly because beforehand metrics must be established to determine whether a given algorithm actually aids in this task. Simply identifying a large fraction of games where players get injured is insufficent, as injured games are rare, and algorithms with even a modest false positive (FP) rate may result in players actually playing less games overall.

The data for this project was complied from three distinct sources: first, NBA injuries from the 2010-2020 were downloaded from the [Pro Sports Transactions](https://www.prosportstransactions.com/basketball/Search/Search.php) website, using both the "Missed games due to injury" and the "Movement to/from injured/inactive list (IL)" filters. The second filter is necessary as these two catergories are mutually exclusive, and the first catergory misses many injuries. See [this notebook](download_inj_data.ipynb) for details.

This list of injuries is then correlated with the game the player was injured in, using game logs from [Basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) [(see this notebook).](make_inj_df.ipynb) We use custom scrapers to pull not just the games the player was injured in, but all stats from the 2010-2020 seasons for each player that appears in our list of injuries. We also pull metadata for each player, i.e. their height, weight, which hand they shoot with, and their listed position on Basketball reference. We also classify players as a "Guard," "Wing," or "Big" using their listed position on Basketball reference. Finally, we filter out all players who didn't average at least 15 minutes per game over their career.

This list of games will constitute the entries in our training data, but we obviously can't use the the statistics from the games themselves as features. One thing we can do immediately with this data is determine the distribution of the number of games players miss due to injuries.

The data have mean $\mu = 5.889$, and standard deviation $\sigma = 10.470$.
